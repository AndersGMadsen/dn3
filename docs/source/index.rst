Welcome to the Deep Neurophysiology Toolbox (DNPT)'s documentation!
===================================================================

This Python package tries to effectively bridge the gap between the neuroscience library MNE-Python and
the deep learning library PyTorch. This package tries to minimize boilerplate, leverage known solutions quickly and
increase reproducibility of new deep-learning solutions to the analysis of M/EEG data (in particular).
